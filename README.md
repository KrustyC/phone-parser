# phone-parser
Repo to parse some phone numbers, which is needed by a friend of mine

## Install and Run

Make sure to have NodeJS v14.13.1 installed then run `npm install` to install all dependencies. 

Add an `input.csv` file under the `files/` folder, then run `npm parse-csv`. This will create a file called `output.csv` under the `files/` folder, with all the phone numbers parsed.
